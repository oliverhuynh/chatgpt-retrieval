# chatgpt-retrieval

Simple script to use ChatGPT on your own files.

Here's the [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/9AXP7tCI9PI).

## Installation

Install [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and other required packages.
```
pip install langchain openai chromadb tiktoken unstructured
```
Modify `constants.py.default` to use your own [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and rename it to `constants.py`.

To route requests through a proxy (or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible API), set `OPENAI_TARGET` in a `.env` file or your shell, e.g. `OPENAI_TARGET=https://a-proxy-web`. The script will automatically send `/v1/chat/completions` traffic to that host. You can also override the model with `OPENAI_MODEL` (defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo`).

Place your own data into `data/data.txt`.

## Example usage
Test reading `data/data.txt` file.
```
> python chatgpt.py "what is my dog's name"
Your dog's name is Sunny.
```

Test reading `data/cat.pdf` file.
```
> python chatgpt.py "what is my cat's name"
Your cat's name is Muffy.
```
